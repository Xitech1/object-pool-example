# object-pool-example:
An example of coding an Object Pool in Unity.

# How to use:
Drag and drop the Turret prefab into the scene, play the game and press space to launch a bullet via the Object Pool.

Note, there's room for improvement. E.g. rather than returning null, you can generate a new object instead and add it to the pool. Good luck :).
